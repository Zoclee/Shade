# {Zoclee}™ Shade

[{Zoclee}™ Shade](http://www.zoclee.com/shade) is a virtual machine used for the testing and debugging of SPIR-V binaries. 

## About

[SPIR-V](http://www.khronos.org/registry/spir-v/) is a platform-independent intermediate language, designed by [Khronos](http://www.khronos.org), for representing graphical-shader stages and compute kernels for multiple APIs. The full [SPIR-V](http://www.khronos.org/registry/spir-v/) specification is available for download from the [Khronos](http://www.khronos.org) website.

The primary goal of [{Zoclee}™ Shade](http://www.zoclee.com/shade), is to provide a convenient platform for testing and debugging [SPIR-V](http://www.khronos.org/registry/spir-v/) binaries. Please note however that [{Zoclee}™ Shade](http://www.zoclee.com/shade) is currently work in progress.

## Features

* Open SPIR-V binary files.
* View SPIR-V instructions in a human-readable format.
* Validate correctness of opcodes (e.g. missing types, out of bound indexes etc.).
* Track error opcodes easily by clicking on error messages. 
* Remove debug instructions from SPIR-V binaries.
* Undo changes made to binary.
* Search SPIR-V instruction text.
